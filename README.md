## Features

- **Multi-source package management**: Support for pacman, AUR, Flatpak, and npm packages
- **Graphical user interface**: Built with PyQt6 for a smooth desktop experience
- **Plugin system**: Extensible with plugins for additional tools and utilities
- **Bundle management**: Create and manage package bundles for easy deployment
- **Security-focused**: Requires appropriate privileges for package installation to maintain system security

## Installation

### From AUR (Recommended)

Install neoarch-git from the Arch User Repository using your preferred AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S neoarch-git  # or paru -S neoarch-git, etc.
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6
- Arch Linux system
- Administrative privileges (sudo) for package management

### Install Dependencies

Option A — Recommended (Arch packages)

```bash
# Install system packages from official repos
sudo pacman -S --needed python python-pyqt6 python-requests qt6-svg git flatpak nodejs npm
```

Option B — Use a Python virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_pyqt.txt
```

Note: On Arch, using system `pip` often triggers the "externally-managed-environment" error. Prefer Option A (pacman) or install into a virtual environment (Option B). Alternatively, you can install apps with `pipx` (`sudo pacman -S python-pipx`) which manages a dedicated venv for each app.

### Run Aurora

```bash
# If you created a virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # skip if not using a venv

python aurora_home.py
```

## Security Notice

As a package manager, Aurora requires administrative privileges to install, update, and remove system packages. This is essential for maintaining system security and integrity. The application will prompt for authentication when performing privileged operations.
